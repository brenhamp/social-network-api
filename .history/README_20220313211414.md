## Description

This API uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to maintain a list of users, their posts ("thoughts"), and their replies to posts ("reactions"). Users can add, update, and delete posts, comment on other users' posts, and add and remove friends.

## Installation

Use 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install Express and mongoose. Then use the command 'npm start' to run the server. You will need a client like Insomnia to send requests.

## Usage

Simply navigate the prompts and provide info as inquirer requests it. You should have no problem navigating the database with the user-friendly interface.

## Demonstration

This video will demonstrate all the functions of Employee Tracker.

## Challenges

This was one of my hardest challenges. I kept struggling to get the right data to return. Role ID and department ID in particular kept returning null, and I couldn't figure out why. Turns out I needed to add [0] to return the first value in the array (id). This was also just quite a bit of tricky JavaScript to write, with many moving parts.
