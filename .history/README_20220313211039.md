## Installation

![setup video](./assets/employee-tracker-installation.gif)

Install all the required packages. Make sure you have MySQL installed and log in. Then source the schema and (optional) the seed file. You should be able to browse the database through MySQL as usual. Once you've confirmed that the database is up and running, run npm start to begin the inquirer prompts.

## Usage

Simply navigate the prompts and provide info as inquirer requests it. You should have no problem navigating the database with the user-friendly interface.

## Demonstration

This video will demonstrate all the functions of Employee Tracker.

## Challenges

This was one of my hardest challenges. I kept struggling to get the right data to return. Role ID and department ID in particular kept returning null, and I couldn't figure out why. Turns out I needed to add [0] to return the first value in the array (id). This was also just quite a bit of tricky JavaScript to write, with many moving parts.
