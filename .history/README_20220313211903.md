## Description

This API uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to maintain a list of users, their posts ("thoughts"), and their replies to posts ("reactions"). Users can add, update, and delete posts, comment on other users' posts, and add and remove friends.

## Installation

Use 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install Express and mongoose. Then use the command 'npm start' to run the server. You will need a client like Insomnia to send requests.

## Usage

Send requests through your client. These are all the routes used:
- User: GET all, POST (api/users)GET by ID, , PUT, DELETE *
- Thought: GET all, GET by ID, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Friends: POST, DELETE
- Reactions: POST, DELETE

## Demonstration

This video will demonstrate all the functions of Employee Tracker.

## Challenges

This was one of my hardest challenges. I kept struggling to get the right data to return. Role ID and department ID in particular kept returning null, and I couldn't figure out why. Turns out I needed to add [0] to return the first value in the array (id). This was also just quite a bit of tricky JavaScript to write, with many moving parts.
